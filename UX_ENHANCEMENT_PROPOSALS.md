# AI Writing Assistant - UX Enhancement Proposals

## ðŸŽ¯ Implemented: Auto-Scroll & Enhanced Highlighting

### Auto-Scroll on Hover
- **Feature**: When hovering over feedback cards, the writing area automatically scrolls to highlight the relevant text section
- **Behavior**: Smooth scroll animation with 3-line buffer above the highlighted text
- **Visual Enhancement**: Enhanced highlight effects with scale, shadow, and ring animations

### Enhanced Highlighting System
- **Color-coded by type**: Different colors for intellectual, stylistic, and inquiry integration feedback
